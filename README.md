# Ironman Mark 3 Suit

This repository was created to contain the code used to make my Ironman Mark 3 costume function. Whilst it looks like there were not many commits, please believe me that there were countless other throw away projects that I made use of before ending up with this pretty distilled setup for my code.

Pictures of the suit can be found at this here:

There are a number of projects in the solution, aimed at targeted parts of t he suit. It did result in some of the builds being much quicker than others and also smaller in size.
I do have some parts that need to be added to complete the codebase for the suit but I was feeling burnt out after 7 months of working on the full build whilst also working full time, have other hobbies.... and try to be a somewhat present husband.

## Whats missing
The code for running the arc reactor has intentionally been missed out because whilst it was functional, I wanted to work out a different way to do the animations that were not so clunky, once I have worked out how to make the animations work much more smoothly I will add those into the main codebase.

The code for running the calf flaps were also never written because I didnt like the idea of either stuffing lipo batteries next to my calf muscles and then knocking something or damaging them somehow, and I also didnt like the idea of running cables from somewhere else in the suit to the calf servos.
